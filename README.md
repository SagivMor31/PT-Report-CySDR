# CySDR - Penetration Testing Report

## Overview
This repository contains the penetration testing report for CySDR. The security assessment identified two critical wireless vulnerabilities: Wi-Fi signal jamming and key fob relay attacks. These vulnerabilities pose significant risks to smart city environments.

## Key Findings
- **Wi-Fi Signal Jamming**: Unauthorized signal disruption at 2.42 GHz, affecting Wi-Fi cameras.
- **Key Fob Relay Attack**: Replicating key fob signals to unlock vehicles without physical access.

## Remediation
- Implement Wireless Intrusion Prevention Systems (WIPS).
- Use frequency hopping to protect against jamming.
